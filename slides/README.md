The slides are written in Markdown and presented in the reveal.js format being
generated using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).


#### Generating slides

To build them install Quarto and then run, from this directory:
```bash
quarto render rse-skills.qmd
```

#### Editing slides

To edit the slides please see the contents of `rse-skills.qmd` and the other sub-.qmd files.
.qmd is a Quarto Markdown file.

Images are placed in `/images/` and BibTeX references are in `references.bib`.
